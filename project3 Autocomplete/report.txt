3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Autocomplete Term)
       Approach: It is straightforward,just follow the checklist.

       Issues and resolution: No issues.

   Problem 2 (Binary Search Deluxe)
       Approach: Just follow the checklist.

       Issues: I had a err message from firstIndexOf method "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:
       Index 0 out of bounds for length 0"

       Resolution: My BinarySearchDelux is working fine. I reread the err message found that
      the bounds of ArrayIndex has something wrong, so I added a condition to judge that the length
       of Key[] a equals to zero or not, if it`s equals 0, return -1 means nothing in a, the
       next operation cannot be performed at all and that not make sense.

   Problem 3 (Autocomplete)
       Approach: Just follow the checklist.

       Issues: I had err message from test case 94) expected value:0 actual value:1 from calling
       <numberOfMatches>

       Resolution:I checked the numberOfMatches method found my return statemenst is wrong. My
       original return is 'return 1 + BinarySearchDeluxe.lastIndexOf - BinarySearchDeluxe
       .firstIndexOf'. If both BinarySearchDeluxe.lastIndexOf and BinarySearchDeluxe.lastIndexOf
       return -1 that means 1+(-1-(-1)) = 1+0 = 1, but actually nothing matches, we should return 0.
       SO I break my return statement down to two separate int variable x and y to store lastIndex
       and firstIndex, and I added a condition to judge if x or y equals to -1 then return 0. After
       added it, my err message disappeared.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Learning compareable and comparator concept from SI section, it`s really help me understand the
   problem 1.
